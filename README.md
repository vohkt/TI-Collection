### xCyclopedia
The xCyclopedia project attempts to document all executable binaries (and eventually scripts) that reside on a typical operating system. It provides a web page to view the data as well as a machine-readable format (JSON and CSV) that can be immediately usable in other systems such as SIEMs to enrich observed executions with contextual data.
